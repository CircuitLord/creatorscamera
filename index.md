## Creator's Camera
Creator's Camera is a program for content creators that allows them to make cinematics in games that don't have a keyframing system.

### I want to see it in action.
Fair enough.

### How does it work?
Creator's Camera emulates joystick movement on a virtual controller that is detected by games. It then reads scripts that you can make to do fancy camera movements.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/CircuitLord/creatorscamera/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
